# Exp 171
[Problem 171](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-number/description/)

### Solution
Not a hard problem if we consider it in logic thinking. It's just a problem about translate a num from 26-hexadecimal to 10-hexadecimal.
From this problem I get to know how to use ord() to get the ASCII num, and also get familiar with the usage of enumerate, Lambda and map/reduce. It helps a lot.
