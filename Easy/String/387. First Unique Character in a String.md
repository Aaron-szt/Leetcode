[Problem 387](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/description/)

### Solution
Not so easy for me cause I'm still not quite familiar with those attributes in Python. By taking a look at other people's solution, I set up an alphabet and search each of the letter in string s to find the letter that shows up once. Then their indexs are stored in a list called 'index'. Finally, we just need to use 'min()' to find out the minimal number in the list 'index'.
