[Problem 606](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/description/)

### Solution
do this recursively.

1. If the tree is empty, we return an empty string.
2. We record each child as ‘(’ + (string of child) + ‘)’
3. If there is a right child but no left child, we still need to record ‘()’ instead of empty string.
