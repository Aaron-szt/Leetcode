[Problem 647](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/description/)

### Solution
My solution is to check if the sub-sequence is Palindromic only when its first charactor is same as the last charactor and the second one is same as the last second one. This solution can only beat 33% in time cost.
The solution I learned from the discussion is the idea called "Center Expansion", which is much more efficient because a sub-sequence can be Palindromic only when it's center is Palindromic. This idea saves a lot of time wasted in my algorithm.
